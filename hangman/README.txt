The biggest challenge for this project was figuring out how to generate families for each guessed letter. I figured out an easy
solution to this by checking for a given letter in a word, and if it was present, making a string representing the word,
with 1s correlating to a place where the guessed letter is present, and 0s being a place where it isn't present. once the word
was converted to 1s and 0s, it was used as a key to the map, letting me add words to families with identical structure
I really liked how this assignment was a game, as it added an aspect that was more fun than most projects. It was also very convenient,
because for my final 261 project i made a hangman game, so I was able to recycle a large portion of code that I had already made.
I spent about 4-5 hours in total working on the project
